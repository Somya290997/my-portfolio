        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>With 3 years of experience as a Data Engineer at Mastercard, I’ve had the opportunity to build and optimize data pipelines that power key business decisions. Along the way, I’ve worked with a variety of tools and technologies, including Scala, Spark, SQL, Python, Java, Apache Hadoop, Apache NiFi, and cloud platforms, ensuring real-time data flow with 100% Reconciliation accuracy.
            Currently, I’m pursuing a Master’s degree in Computer Science from University of Colorado Boulder, which is giving me the chance to dive deeper into areas of Machine learning, AI, NLP, Neural Networks, and data architecture. The combination of hands-on experience and academic learning keeps me sharp and excited about applying emerging technologies to solve real-world challenges.
            I’m truly passionate about using data to innovate, improve processes, and drive smarter decisions. I’m always eager to collaborate with others who share a similar drive for leveraging data to make a difference.</p>
